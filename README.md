# BLOCKVIRUS
Blockvirus group's repository for EUvsVIRUS hackathon.
In here, you will find the progress made by the team BLOCKVIRUS during the PanEuropean Hackathon EUvsVIRUS, which aims to give real solutions to problems which Covid-19 pandemia's has induced during the last months all over the globe.

## Blockchain as a tool for beating the virus
Our target is to monitorize the production chain of some of the most valuable devices for healthcare during the pandemia (i.e. facemasks). Using state-of-the-art blockchain algorithms and implementing an online interface we will manage to register each step of the production of this objects preventing factories from outside of the EU community of submitting defective packs to each country gonvernment.
